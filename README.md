  <h1>SpaceShield DevOps</h1>
  <p>A comprehensive DevOps pipeline for space debris monitoring and collision prediction</p>
</div>

## Overview

**SpaceShield DevOps** is an end-to-end DevOps solution designed to automate, deploy, monitor, and scale the SpaceShield application. This project leverages modern DevOps tools and practices to ensure reliability, scalability, and observability.

---

## Features

- **CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins:**  
  Automates building, testing, and deploying the SpaceShield application using Jenkins pipelines.

- **Containerization with Docker:**  
  All application components are containerized for consistency and portability.

- **Orchestration with Kubernetes:**  
  Deploys and manages containers at scale, ensuring high availability and easy rollouts/rollbacks.

- **Monitoring with Prometheus:**  
  Collects and stores metrics from application services and infrastructure.

- **Visualization with Grafana:**  
  Provides real-time dashboards and alerts based on metrics collected by Prometheus.

## Architecture

```
[Jenkins] --> [Docker] --> [Kubernetes Cluster]
                                 |
                        [Prometheus] <--> [Grafana]
```

- **Jenkins** automates the CI/CD process.
- **Docker** packages the application and dependencies.
- **Kubernetes** manages deployment, scaling, and service discovery.
- **Prometheus** scrapes and stores metrics.
- **Grafana** visualizes metrics and sets up alerts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (Minikube, k3s, or a cloud provider)
- Jenkins
- Prometheus & Grafana

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpaceShield-DevOps.git
   cd SpaceShield-DevOps
   ```

2. **Start Jenkins, MySQL, and other services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Build and push Docker images:**
   ```bash
   # Example for backend
   docker build -t yourrepo/backend:latest ./backend
   docker push yourrepo/backend:latest
   ```

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

5. **Access Grafana dashboards:**
   - Default URL: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Login with default credentials and import dashboards.
